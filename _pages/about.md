I am a Ph.D. student in Autonomous Systems & Connectivity at the University of Glasgow, supervised by [Dr. Jianglin Lan](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/jianglinlan/). My research focuses on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Reinforcement Learning, and Autonomous Driving systems.

I am currently working on developing advanced autonomous navigation solutions that can operate safely in dynamic environments, with a particular emphasis on visual SLAM systems and trajectory planning.

## Research Interests

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Developing robust methods for simultaneous localization and mapping in dynamic environments
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying RL techniques to autonomous driving scenarios
- **Autonomous Driving**: Creating collision-free navigation systems for lightweight autonomous vehicles
- **Trajectory Planning**: Optimization methods for safe and efficient vehicle trajectory planning
