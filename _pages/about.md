I am a PhD student in Autonomous Systems & Connectivity at the University of Glasgow, supervised by  [Dr. Jianglin Lan](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/jianglinlan/). My research focuses on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Reinforcement Learning, and Autonomous Driving systems.

I am currently working on developing advanced autonomous navigation solutions that can operate safely in dynamic environments, with a particular emphasis on visual SLAM systems and trajectory planning.

Research Interests
======
**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Developing robust methods for simultaneous localization and mapping in dynamic environments

**Reinforcement Learning**: Applying RL techniques to autonomous driving scenarios

**Autonomous Driving**: Creating collision-free navigation systems for lightweight autonomous vehicles

**Computer Vision**: Integrating semantic information for improved scene understanding

**Trajectory Planning**: Optimization methods for safe and efficient vehicle trajectory planning
