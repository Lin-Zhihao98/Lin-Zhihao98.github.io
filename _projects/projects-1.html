        <figcaption style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: Arial;">Fig. 1: Workflow of our DPL-SLAM system. The dynamic object clearing system works in four stages. It begins by extracting point-line features
            from input images. Then, it identifies potential dynamic regions through object detection and epipolar constraint validation. Next, depending on the
            proportion of dynamic features within each box, it selectively removes features. Lastly, it updates the remaining stable features for camera pose
            recovery in the backend processing. This system effectively manages dynamic object exclusion in SLAM operations.</figcaption>
